                    <p lead>Hello All! My name is Becca and I am excited to get to know you all. I got my start at the
                        Art Institute
                        of Atlanta studying to be an illustrator, but discovered quickly that I did not have the
                        necessary passion
                        for that field. I completely switched directions after a year and went on to get my Bachelor's
                        degree in
                        Psychology from the University of Georgia.</p>
                    <p lead>Once in the professional world, I discovered you cannot do a whole lot with just a
                        Bachelor's in
                        Psychology and I found myself in the mortgage world doing cold calling. Needless to say, this
                        was not super
                        exciting and I was incredibly jealous of my husband's job in sales. I decided to try my hand at
                        that and
                        discovered I was strangely good at selling mattresses. I was even good at management! Sadly, an
                        injury made
                        it impossible for me to continue carrying queen size beds and heavy frames around so I found
                        myself back in
                        the mortgage world for a few years.</p>
                    <p lead>Fast forward to today and you find me with an incredible baby boy who is my whole world and
                        my amazing
                        husband. We love to spend time making new memories and giving our son new experiences. We enjoy
                        travelling,
                        trying new foods, and watching movies.</p>
